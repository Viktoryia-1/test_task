# SUMMARY
It was interesting task, I really enjoy it.
Hear are few thoughts about model performed.
1) It's an ideal model. i didn't find any mistakes druring evaluation.
2) Predictions was artifically generated.
Actually, I have more confidence in second option, because we have:
a) Imbalanced classes
b) I didn't fined a lot of statistical difference in features between 4/6/8 corners groups
during doing statistical tests. In few features we may see difference between 4 and 6/
4 and 8 groups, but I didn't find it between 6 and 8 groups.(I tested data with Kruskal-Wallis
criterion too, with the same result. Sadly I don't show it because i couldn't imagin a plot)
Even if we consider feature 'name',
wich may be useful for model, it isn't enough for 100% hit.
But maybe I am wrong, I would like to now the truth)
